title: Evolution Fresh

description: Evolution Fresh asked us to craft an animation that explained why their juices are better than the competition by educating them on what makes them different. I developed an illustration style that brought some life into their already defined watercolor aesthetic.

results: The result is a whimsical animation that eloquently communicates the value of Evolution Fresh over their competition. This video was used in their new landing page and has over 30k views to date.
