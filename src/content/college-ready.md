title: College Ready

description: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation came to us to help them find the best way to communicate the concept of technology-driven personalized education. We wrote, designed and animated a video that takes the viewer on a journey of discovery as well as its benefits to teachers worldwide. I brought in the talented Yaniv Fridman and Daniel Luna to bring the idea to life and was in charge of creative and animation direction.

results: The result was the most cutting edge piece of promotional material ever created for the Gates Foundation. It has been used to introduce College Ready representatives at international summits around the world.
