title: Halo Online

description: Halo is one of the most successful game franchises of all time and the team at Microsoft Studios was looking to expand the franchise by launching a free-to-play version of the title. They came to us to help them create a top tier user experience for their users as well as a purchasing mechanism for their in-game market. I was in charge of interface and interaction design, art direction and prototyping.

results: The result of our endeavor is a user-validated user flow applied in a high fidelity user interface that is familiar with old-time halo users whilst providing a low barrier of entry for new players.

Users have a 60 second window between matches to edit and upgrade their arsenal and it was up to us to create the most productive method to display and move users through this flow.

Once the design was validated we developed design and animation guidelines early on that could be implemented in development whilst still working on the rest of the gameplay experience.
