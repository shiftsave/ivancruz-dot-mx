title: Rubi Kiosk

description: Rubi is an exciting new service that delivers delicious fresh coffee on demand. The team at Rubi came to us for help to help them devise a way to better engage with their customer as they used the service. I was in charge of rethinking the interaction design and creating materials to engage customers while their coffee is brewing.


results: After the revised design was implemented the team saw a significant increase in both adoption and positive word of mouth. Rubi is set to expand into the midwest later this year.

Speed and reliability is what Rubi is built upon and so we re-designed the flow to guide customers seamlessly through the entire process in just a few simple interactions. We established a design language that is clear and approachable.

Each cup flavor is unique and each cup takes about 90 seconds to brew. I developed an animation system that delivered personalized animations based on the user's selections during the selection process.
